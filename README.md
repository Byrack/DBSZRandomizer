Me and my friend thought it was boring just picking characters we wanted to play in sparking zero, so we started playing characters from different parts of the story.
We used chatgpt to generate one arc and one movie, so one of us got like bojack unbound while the other one could get tournament of power or something.
Using chatgpt worked for a while, but it was a bit slow at times and sometimes it would just stop working. So i made my own randomizer, with support for modded characters like Moro or super saiyan 5.
It's a bit janky at times, might fix it in the future but we'll see, if you're gonna turn on "One Movie, One saga" turn on "every other" too. (otherwise one player will always get the movie)
